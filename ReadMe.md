This firmware is a complete overhaul of the [Official Firmware](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware), it also features some of the badly implemented ideas from RogueMaster, and lots of awesome code-bits from [Unleashed](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware).

<h2 align="center">What makes it special?</h2>

I have spent many hours perfecting this code even further, and getting the most out of it.

The goal of this Firmware is to regularly bring out amazing updates based on what the community wants, with an actual understanding of whats going on. Fixing bugs that are regularly talked about, removing unstable / broken applications (.FAP) and actually using the level system that just sits abandoned everywhere else.
<br><br>
- The focus of this firmware is functionality & stability: If an App doesnt work, its gone

- Giving the level system a purpose: Right now, each level unlocks a new wallpaper. More on that below

- Clean upgraded code: RM wrote some updates to certain files. These are... painful, to say the least. Here its all built with perfection in mind and integrated in a mostly clean way. I invite you all to compare the code with theirs.

- Up2Date: This firmware receives updates from a few repositories, not just from its Upstream. If there are functional, but yet un-merged Pull requests on another flipper firmware that are good, they will be in here!

<br>
<h2 align="center">Animations:</h2>

This firmware contains NSFW animations and uses these in stock (NSFW) mode.

The animations are tied to the level system. Each level you reach, unlocks a new animation. The higher your level, the more lewd it will become. Rumors have it, I'm  to be found in at least one of those too

| Level  | Animations |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1-10  | Try harder. Just sexy clothes |
| 11-20 | Some tits, maybe an ass |
| 21-30 | Fully NSFW, graphic scenes |

If you dont like that, we added an SFW mode to the Firmware. From the main menu, hit `Arrow UP` and select SFW mode and now all assets will be stock.

<h2 align="center">Known Bugs:</h2>

```txt

```

<br>
<h2 align="center">Install:</h2>

**NOTE: If you are coming from a different FW, it is recommended to delete / clear your "apps" folder on the SD card prior to updating. This folder houses all the .fap files, which do not update to the correct API versions by default if old ones are present (Thanks flipper devs). This does `NOT` remove any of your saved files!**
<br><br>

- Download the latest release (.zip) from [The releases tab](https://github.com/ClaraCrazy/Flipper-Xtreme/releases/latest)
- Extract the archive. This is now your new Firmware folder
- Open [qFlipper](https://flipperzero.one/update), head to `SD/Update` and simply move the firmware folder there
- On the Flipper, hit the `Arrow Down` button, this will get you to the file menu. Hit `Arrow Left` once, and then simply search for your updates folder
- Inside that folder, select the Firmware you just moved onto it, and run the file thats simply called `Update`

- Enjoy!

<h2 align="center">Build it yourself:</h2>

```bash
To download the needed tools:
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/wasabicoat/Flipper-Xtreme.git
$ cd Flipper-Xtreme/

To flash directly to the Flipper (Needs to be connected via USB, qFlipper closed)
$ ./fbt flash_usb

To just compile firmware
$ ./fbt updater_package

If building FAPS:
$ ./fbt fap_dist

If building image assets:
$ ./fbt resources icons dolphin_ext
